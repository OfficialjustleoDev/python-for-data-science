# Python for Data Science – Day 1 Foundations

## 📌 Description  
Built a foundational data analysis notebook to practice loading, exploring, cleaning, and analysing healthcare data using Python. This project focuses on developing core data science skills with pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python  
- pandas (DataFrames, filtering, groupby)  
- numpy (numerical operations)  
- matplotlib (data visualisation)  
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)

## ⚙️ Features  
- Loads healthcare dataset from CSV file  
- Explores data using `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()`  
- Filters and selects data based on conditions  
- Groups data to generate insights  
- Creates basic visualisations (histograms and bar charts)

## 📚 What I Learned  
- How to load and inspect real-world datasets  
- Data cleaning and handling missing values  
- Using `groupby` for data summarisation  
- Translating questions into data queries  
- Building confidence working with data in Python
